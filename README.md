# Psychic-Game
The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.  When the player wins, the Wins counter increase and we start the game over again (without refreshing the page). When the player loses, the Losses counter increases and restarts the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
